\description{
Pipeline for OPLS models, variable selection and permutation
}
\details{
Performs variable selection using p(corr) and optionally VIP. In addition to permutation post variable
selection included in the ropls package also permutations pre variable selection with proceeding
variable selection of every permutation resulting in p-values for R2 and Q2 including the variable
selection procedure. It produces tables of all group comparisons including optional stratification
by secondary ID.

In filename_sampleID and in filename_matrix do not use the following symbols in sampleID or variable names;
?, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, #, ?, ,, <, >, /, |, , ], {, } and [
Missing values should be indicated by "", "NA" or "Inf"
