\description{
Pipeline for OPLS models, variable selection and permutations pre, post and over variable selection
}
\details{
Performs opls models comparing all groups to eachother, performs variable selection using 5 strategies
all based on p(corr) and optionally VIP. Produces scores plots, loading plots, rock curves and significant
testing. In addition to permutation pre and post variable
selection included in the ropls package also permutations over variable selection with proceeding
variable selection of every permutation resulting in p-values for R2 and Q2 including the variable
selection procedure. It produces tables of all group comparisons including optional stratification
by metadata.

In filename_sampleID and in filename_matrix do not use the following symbols in sampleID or variable names;
?, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, #, ?, ,, <, >, /, |, , ], {, }, [, and $
Missing values should be indicated by "", "NA" or "Inf"

## The function may be run using the workflow setting the parameters in the files
## roplspvs_Configure_Get_Started.R and roplspvs_Configure_Advanced.R. These files are
## saved in your project folder where also a folder namned data containing your datamatrix
## and metadata matrix is saved. This is where your result folder outputR is generated. To run example data:

setwd("<path to your project folder>")
source("<path to roplspvs>/Roplspvs_Run.R")
